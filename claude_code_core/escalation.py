"""Explicit escalation: ask a strong external model one self-contained question.

This is the other half of the local-first design. A thread does its work on a
model you control; when it needs research, a second opinion or a plan, exactly
one anonymized question goes out and exactly one answer comes back.

What makes the claim checkable is that the external CLI runs with **no context
of its own**. That is not a documented procedure — it is verified immediately
before every spawn, because a procedure that can be skipped when someone is in
a hurry always eventually is:

1. ``--setting-sources ""`` — no CLAUDE.md, skills or memory.
2. An **empty** temporary directory as cwd — nothing local to read.
3. Every tool disallowed — no shell to escape the directory with.
4. ``--`` before the prompt — without it the variadic tool list eats the
   prompt and the CLI dies with "Input must be provided...".

Point 1 is not paranoia. Measured with cwd=/home/ebi and every tool already
disabled, changing *only* ``--setting-sources``: with it, the model reported
that a term unique to the project's CLAUDE.md was absent from its context;
without it, present. A naive escalation ships the whole file — customer names
included — no matter how carefully the question was anonymized.
