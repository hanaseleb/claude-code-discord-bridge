"""Local-model backend: the Codex CLI driven by a model on your own hardware.

The point of this backend is a claim that can be checked: while a thread runs
locally, nothing about it reaches a vendor. Pointing the CLI at a local model
is *not* enough to make that true — measured on codex-cli 0.145.0, a run
configured entirely against a local endpoint still opened a connection to
``chatgpt.com`` for the startup update check and analytics, and it did so even
with an empty ``CODEX_HOME`` and no credentials.

So ccdb does not reuse the user's ``~/.codex``. It generates and owns a
separate ``CODEX_HOME`` whose ``config.toml`` points at the local endpoint and
switches both callers-home off. Measured again with that config, the only
endpoint contacted was the local model.

Two consequences worth keeping in mind:

* The guarantee is **measured, not enforced**. A future CLI version could add a
  new call home. ``verify_quiet_settings()`` re-checks the settings we know
  about on every spawn, and the docs say to re-measure after a CLI upgrade.
* The check is structural, so it works the same on Linux, macOS and Windows.
  An OS-level egress rule would be stronger and is not portable; for a
  framework that ships to other people, the config ccdb controls is the right
  trade.
