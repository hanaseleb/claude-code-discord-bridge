"""Where a reply goes.

Teams does not have one API host. Each activity names the regional Bot
Connector that owns its conversation, and a reply has to go back to that one —
so "the address of a conversation" is a pair, not an id.

Splitting it out of :class:`~claude_teams.activity.InboundActivity` matters
because most of what ccdb does is *not* a reply. A scheduled task, a webhook,
and the REST API all want to post into a conversation nobody just spoke in, and
they have no inbound activity to hold.
