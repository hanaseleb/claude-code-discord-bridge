"""The aiohttp glue, kept in one file so the rest of the package has none.

Every module that talks to a network takes its transport as a callable. That is
not indirection for its own sake: it is what lets the token cache, the key
rotation policy and the endpoint's refusal rules be tested exactly, with no
HTTP server and no sleeping. This file is the one place that knows about
aiohttp, and it is deliberately thin enough to read in full.

Error bodies are never included in raised messages. The token endpoint in
particular echoes request parameters back in ``error_description``, and the
request carries the client secret.
