"""Proving an inbound request really came from the Bot Connector.

Discord's transport was outbound-only: the bot dialled out over a websocket and
nothing on the internet could reach it. Teams reverses that. The endpoint is a
public HTTPS URL, and behind it sit coding-agent sessions with a shell. The
verification in this module is therefore not an authentication nicety — it is
the entire boundary.

The rules come from the Bot Framework authentication specification:

* signature must verify against a key published at the Bot Connector's OpenID
  metadata document, using an asymmetric algorithm we name explicitly
* ``iss`` must be the Bot Connector's issuer
* ``aud`` must be this bot's application id
* the token must be unexpired
* the ``serviceUrl`` claim must match the activity's own ``serviceUrl``

That last one carries more weight than it looks like. The activity body tells
this process where to send its reply, and the reply carries this process's
credentials. Without binding the two, a genuine token replayed with a doctored
body aims our authenticated outbound calls at a host of the caller's choosing.

Algorithms are pinned rather than taken from the token header, because the
header is attacker-controlled: the app id is printed in the manifest, and a
verifier that honours ``alg`` will happily treat an RSA public key as an HMAC
secret if asked.
