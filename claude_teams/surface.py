"""``TeamsSurface`` — one Teams conversation, speaking the shared vocabulary.

This is where the abstraction earns its keep or does not. The protocol names
intents; this file decides what each intent *is* in Teams, and the answers are
mostly not what Discord does:

============================  ==========================  =====================
Intent                        Discord                     Teams (here)
============================  ==========================  =====================
a long answer                 fifteen messages            one message
``open_activity``             an embed per tool           a line on one card
``set_status``                emoji on the user's         the status row of
                              message                     that same card
``deliver_files``             inline attachment           **not yet** — see
                                                          below
============================  ==========================  =====================

The card is the centrepiece. A tool starting, the status changing and a tool
finishing are three events and one operation — repaint — so inside a single
pacing interval they cost one slot rather than three. Given 1,800 operations
per hour per conversation, that difference is the difference between a session
that keeps showing its work for an hour and one that goes quiet halfway
through.

Prompts, and failing closed
---------------------------
``prompt_choice`` posts an Adaptive Card and waits. When the clock runs out it
applies ``default_on_timeout`` — which for a tool-permission request is the
denying choice — and the same fallback runs when the card could not be posted
at all, because "the prompt never reached anyone" and "nobody answered" must
have the same consequence. The contract deliberately does not check this: from
outside, a surface that denies on timeout and one that invents a denial are
indistinguishable. ``TestFailClosed`` in ``tests/test_teams_prompts.py`` is
where it is proved, by withholding the answer.

Files, and the one place they still cannot go
---------------------------------------------
In a personal chat ``deliver_files`` offers each file with a consent card; the
bytes move when the user accepts. In a channel it names the files and says
their contents were **not** sent, because consent cards are personal-scope only
and writing into a channel's folder is a Graph permission this does not have. A
session believing its output was handed over is worse than one that knows it
was not, so the difference is stated rather than smoothed over.
