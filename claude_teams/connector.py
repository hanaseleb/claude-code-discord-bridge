"""Sending and editing activities in a Teams conversation.

The reply goes to the ``serviceUrl`` the conversation named — a regional Bot
Connector host, not a fixed endpoint. That is why :mod:`claude_teams.auth`
binds the token's ``serviceUrl`` claim to the body's: this module will
authenticate to whatever host it is handed, so the check that Microsoft named
the host has to happen before anything reaches here.

Editing is a first-class operation rather than an afterthought. The Teams
experience ccdb is aiming at is one session card that keeps up to date and one
answer that grows in place, which is a stream of edits to two activities — not
the column of new messages Discord's 2,000-character limit forces.
