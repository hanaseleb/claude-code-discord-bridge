"""The session card — Teams' answer to Discord's column of embeds.

Discord posts one embed per tool call because editing is cheap and there is no
hourly ceiling. Teams has 1,800 operations per hour per conversation, so the
same design would spend a long session's whole budget on scrollback. One card
that keeps up to date costs one slot per change however many things changed.

These tests pin the parts of that card a wrong value would quietly break: the
size Teams refuses, the ordering that decides what a user sees, and the actions
that must not appear before something can handle them.
