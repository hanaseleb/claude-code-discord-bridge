"""Configuration dataclass for Claude Code execution.

Bundles all parameters needed to execute Claude Code CLI and stream results
to a Discord thread. Using a dataclass instead of a long positional argument
list makes call sites more readable and extension safer (new fields can be
added without changing every caller).

        worktree_manager: WorktreeManager for automatic session worktree cleanup.
