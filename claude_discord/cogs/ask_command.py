"""`/ask` — send one anonymized question to a strong external model.

The companion to the local-model backend: a thread does its work locally, and
when it needs research, a second opinion or a plan, the human sends exactly one
question out. The external model gets no tools, no files and no project
context, so what left the machine is exactly the line recorded in the audit log.

The command is only registered when a rules file exists. Without one there is
nothing to anonymize, and a `/ask` that quietly forwards real names would be
worse than no command at all.
