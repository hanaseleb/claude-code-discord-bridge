"""ThreadSummaryRepository — running summaries for long external threads.

Some ingest clients (notably the Teams browser extension) keep talking in a
single upstream thread for months, accumulating hundreds of messages. Re-sending
the whole history to every ingest run is wasteful. Instead the client sends only
the *new* messages (a diff) and ccdb keeps a compact running summary of the
thread, keyed by a stable client-provided ``summary_key`` (e.g. the Teams thread
root message id).

The flow:

1. Before exporting, the client calls ``GET /api/ingest/summary?key=...`` to read
   the stored summary and ``marker`` (the newest upstream message already folded
   into the summary). It exports only messages newer than ``marker``.
2. On ingest, ccdb injects the stored summary into the prompt so the Claude
   session has full historical context even though the attachment is just the
   diff.
3. When the session finishes, Claude POSTs an updated summary back
   (``POST /api/ingest/summary``); ccdb advances ``marker`` to the newest message
   from that ingest, atomically with the new summary text.

Only the distilled summary + marker are stored here — never the raw messages.
The Discord thread remains the source of truth for any single interaction.
