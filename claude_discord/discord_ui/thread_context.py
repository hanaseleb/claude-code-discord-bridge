"""Recent-history transcript for a channel or thread ccdb has not been following.

When Claude is summoned into a place where humans have been talking, it has
seen none of that conversation: the session either does not exist yet, or it
only remembers the turns it was part of.  Answering "what do you think?" then
means answering with no idea what "it" is.

This module renders that place's recent messages into a compact transcript that
is prepended to the prompt.  Reading the *whole* thread would be the obvious
move and the wrong one — a months-old thread is a huge, mostly irrelevant token
bill — so the window is bounded three ways: by age (``days``), by message count
(``limit``), and by total size (``max_chars``, trimmed from the oldest end so
the turns being replied to always survive).
