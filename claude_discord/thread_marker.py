"""Which threads an agent started, and which agent started them.

A thread created through ``POST /api/spawn`` is indistinguishable from a thread
a human opened by posting in the channel, and Discord exposes no per-thread
colour, badge or icon — the **title** is the only surface available.  Worse,
once several sessions each spawn several children, "an agent started this" is
no longer enough: the channel list becomes a flat pile of identical markers and
the tree that produced it is invisible.

So the title carries two things: that the thread was spawned, and *which family
it belongs to*.  The family code is derived from the spawning thread's own ID
rather than allocated, which means it can always be recomputed from the ID
alone — no counter to keep, and a lost database costs the lineage *records*
without ever costing the lineage *display*.

The marker is prepended, never substituted: the spawning agent keeps naming its
own thread.
