"""Where one deployment keeps its state.

A deployment is ccdb's isolation boundary, and the boundary matters more here
than in most systems. The AI Lounge, the session ledger, claims and collision
detection all work *because* every session in a deployment can see the others —
that is the product. Which means it is also the thing that must never reach
across a customer boundary: one customer's session titles appearing in another
customer's prompt would be a leak produced by the feature working correctly.

The cheapest guarantee is structural: everything a deployment owns hangs off a
single root. Running a second customer on the same server becomes one setting
rather than thirty, and "are they actually isolated?" becomes a question with a
mechanical answer instead of a careful reading of the config.

Which deployment shape a customer gets — our infrastructure, a dedicated Azure
environment we manage, or entirely inside their own tenant — is a commercial
decision that changes *where* this root points and nothing else. That is the
whole reason to have the knob: the shape stops being an architecture question
and becomes a deployment question.

Individual paths can still be overridden, because an existing deployment has to
be able to migrate one file at a time. An override is the only remaining way to
break isolation, so :meth:`DataLayout.paths_outside_root` reports them and
``setup_bridge`` logs them at startup — visible rather than silent.
