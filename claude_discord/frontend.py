"""Discord as a whole frontend, not just one conversation.

:class:`~claude_discord.surface.DiscordSurface` is one thread. This is the
object that hands them out: the seam a scheduler, a webhook or the REST API
uses to reach a conversation *without knowing which platform it lives on*.

Why callers should not keep doing it themselves
-----------------------------------------------
``bot.get_channel(thread_id)`` appears all over the codebase, and each site
re-invents the same three decisions: fall back to ``fetch_channel`` when the
cache is cold, decide whether a non-thread channel is acceptable, and decide
what a missing thread means. They do not all decide the same way, and every one
of them is a place a Teams deployment would have to be patched.

Gathering them here means a scheduled task that resolves its follow-up thread
works on any frontend that implements the protocol — and, just as importantly,
that "the thread was deleted" is answered the same way everywhere: ``None``,
never an exception, because a deleted thread is ordinary and must not take a
scheduler loop down with it.

Contract
--------
This passes :func:`claude_code_core.conformance.check_frontend`, the same suite
a Teams frontend will have to pass. See ``tests/test_discord_frontend.py``.
