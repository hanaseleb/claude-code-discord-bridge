"""Filesystem side of the Teams thread sync — one message, one file.

The vault is the single source of truth. There is no database row and no
client-side marker recording what has been synced: the answer to "what do you
already have?" is computed by looking at the files, every time. That is what
makes the protocol self-healing — delete a message file by hand and the next
sync fetches it again; a half-finished sync simply leaves less on disk and the
next one completes it.

Layout under the sync root (default ``{working_dir}/teams``, beside ``ingest``)::

    orgs.json            team GUID → company name (hand-editable, authoritative)
    {company}/           present once a thread's company is known
    {company}/{title-slug}--{root_mid}/
        thread.json          identity, coverage, pending attachments
        chain.jsonl          append-only order + revision journal
        README.md            how an agent should read this folder
        messages/{mid}.md    one message
        messages/{mid}/...   that message's attachments
        _history/{mid}.{hash8}.md   superseded versions of an edited message
