"""Pure logic for the Teams thread sync API (/api/teams/sync).

A browser extension mirrors upstream Teams threads into a folder tree, one file
per message, so an agent can be pointed at the folder and read the raw
conversation instead of a summary. This module holds every decision that does
not touch the filesystem: validation, identity, hashing comparison, and
rendering. The I/O lives in :mod:`claude_discord.ext.teams_store`.

Identity
--------
Teams gives each message a ``mid`` — a 13-digit Unix-ms string exposed in the
DOM as ``id="content-{mid}"`` and, in Microsoft Graph, as ``chatMessage.id``.
The thread is identified by its root message's mid (``data-reply-chain-id``),
scoped by the team GUID so two teams can never collide. So the primary key is::

    {team}/{root_mid}/{mid}

Because every mid is the same width, sorting filenames as strings sorts them
chronologically — ``ls messages/`` is already a timeline.

Why the hash is opaque
----------------------
The client sends a ``hash`` per message; the server stores it verbatim and
compares the incoming hash against the stored one. The server deliberately does
NOT recompute it. Recomputing would mean reimplementing the client's
normalisation in Python and keeping the two in lockstep forever — and any drift
would show up as a permanent re-sync of every message, silently. Comparing
client hash to stored client hash is always apples-to-apples. If the client ever
changes its algorithm, every message re-syncs exactly once, which is harmless
because the whole protocol is idempotent.
